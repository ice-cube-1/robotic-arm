The arm runs on Python, and most of your code will be parsed just as any other Python code. The only difference is a few pre-written methods and access to the "Barrel" and "Camera" classes. The high-level movement functions provide most of the functionality that the arm offers, although there is also the option to manually control the arm via the arm class (NOTE: calling these directly will not update the web render, and there is no documentation).

Visit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ice-cube-1/robotic-arm) for the full source code, or see how to use some of the arm's [functions](pre-done_functions.md).
